## Can not find your config file

### 1. set by you own

add a config.json file at the root as follow

```json
{
  "docRootPath": "the doc absolute root path",
  "ignoreDirs": [".git", "imgs"]
}
```

### 2. set from the setting

Please take a look, there should be a setting interface around here for you to config some params.
